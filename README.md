**Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python (Google Colab)**
Titanic Dataset Analysis â€” EDA using Python (Google Colab)
Overview

This project explores the famous Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset.
The analysis identifies patterns between passenger features (age, gender, class, fare, etc.) and survival outcomes using Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Dataset**

Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

Features:

survived: 0 = No, 1 = Yes

pclass: Passenger Class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

sex, age, sibsp, parch, fare, embarked, etc.

**Tools & Libraries**

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Google Colab

**Analysis Tasks**

Display first and last 6 passenger records

List attributes and dataset size

Check missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked

Find youngest, oldest, and average age

Calculate average fare and survival patterns

**Key Insights**

Higher survival rates were observed among females and 1st-class passengers

Age and fare showed moderate correlation with survival probability

Cabin data had significant missing values

**How to Run**

Open the notebook in Google Colab

Upload the train.csv dataset

Run all cells sequentially
